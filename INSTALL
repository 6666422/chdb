To build and install chdb you need cmph 0.9 (http://cmph.sourceforge.net/). Once
cmph is installed, you can build chdb by running:
  phpize --with-chdb
  ./configure
  make

And finally you can install it by:
  make install

The configuration script tries to detect the location of cmph automatically.
Should that fail, you can manually specify the prefix directory in which it's
installed by running:
  phpize --with-chdb --with-libcmph-dir=DIR
