To build and install chdb you need cmph 0.9 (http://cmph.sourceforge.net/).

After that is done, you can build and install chdb using pear or you
can choose a manual approach, building chdb by running:
  phpize
  ./configure
  make

And finally installing it by:
  make install

The configuration script tries to detect the location of cmph automatically.
Should that fail, you can manually specify the prefix directory in which it's
installed by running:
  ./configure --with-libcmph-dir=DIR
